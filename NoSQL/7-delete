// 7-delete
// Script to delete all documents where the 'name' field is "Holberton school"
// The method db.collection.deleteMany(filter) is used to ensure all matches are removed.

// Filter criteria: find all documents where name equals "Holberton school"
const filter = { name: "Holberton school" };

// Execute the delete operation
// deleteMany is the best method to ensure all matching documents are deleted.
var result = db.school.deleteMany(filter);

// Print the result object. 
// It will show the status (acknowledged) and the number of documents deleted (deletedCount).
print(result);

// Example output: { "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : N }
