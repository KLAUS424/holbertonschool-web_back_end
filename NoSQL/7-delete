// 7-delete
// Script to delete all documents in the 'school' collection where the 'name' field is "Holberton school".
// The 'deleteMany()' method is used as it aligns with MongoDB v3.6.3 support and the expected
// result format, which includes 'deletedCount'.

// Define the filter criteria: find all documents with name = "Holberton school".
const filter = { name: "Holberton school" };

// Execute the delete operation.
var result = db.school.deleteMany(filter);

// Print the result object.
// Expected output example: { "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : N }
print(result);
